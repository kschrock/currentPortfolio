Developed a functional slot machine prototype using a .NET backend to integrate all
hardware components with a Unity-based game. Implemented animations in Unity with
DOTween and scripted game object behaviors. Established real-time data communica-
tion between the backend and Unity to handle bill validation, ticket printing, and win
tracking.
