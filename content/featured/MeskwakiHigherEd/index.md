This app is a prototype for Meskwaki Higher Ed. This web app can create student and admin accounts, then link the data given from the student; applications, transcripts, courses, etc. This automates the process for the admins to see the applications on the backend and approve or disaprove applicaitons. This stores all the information on AWS and is deployed on Heroku.
