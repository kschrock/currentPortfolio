Meskwaki Higher Ed is a prototype web app that automates the process of approving student applications. The app creates student and admin accounts, then links the data given from the student, such as applications, transcripts, and courses. Admins can easily see the applications on the backend and approve or disapprove them. The app also stores all the information on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and is deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
